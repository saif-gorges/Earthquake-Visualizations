# <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

This project visualizes earthquake data using html,css,Javascript, and Leaflet.

Using USGS GeoJSON Feed to get the data we can visualize all Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days below:

The map above uses Leaflet to plots all of the earthquakes from the data based on their longitude and latitude.
Data markers are used to reflect the magnitude and depth of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes magnitude will appear larger in size and the depth of the earthquake will be reflected in the color.
- Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake.
- Legend added to provide context of the map data.
